In This Repository I have designed a project named "Blog-App-Firebase-Init" 
with React , Material UI, SASS, Redux und React Router, React-Toastify, Google Firebase.

In this project;

• Users could add, update and delete their blocks after logging into the system.
• They could like, rate and comment on the blogs they like.
• They could find the blogs they want by using the search bar.
